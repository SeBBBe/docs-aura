With log forwarding, you can stream logs directly to a cloud project owned by your organization, in real time. The following types of logs are available:

* Security logs
* Query logs

[NOTE]
====
To access log forwarding, you need to have the _Project Admin_ role.
====

To access *Log forwarding*:

. Navigate to *Settings* under the Project section in the sidebar.
. Select *Log forwarding*.

This will display a list of currently configured log forwarding processes for the active project.
Each configuration will show its scope (region or instance) and status (`forwarding`, `setting up` or `paused`).

For actions related to existing configurations, use the `...` button on the right side of the row to open a menu from which the following actions can be taken:

* *View configuration* - Displays the complete details of the configuration.
* *Edit* - Allows you to change the configuration.
* *Delete* - Removes the configuration.

If no log forwarding process is set up, a button to do so is displayed in the center of the page.

== Set up log forwarding

[NOTE]
====
Security is of paramount importance, and therefore the security logs are initially available for free. For query logs, a volume-based egress charge will apply. Please refer to your contract for details.
====

The complete steps for setting up log forwarding depend on the chosen cloud provider.

Exhaustive instructions are provided in the wizard which appears by following the steps below.

. Navigate to the *Log forwarding* page as described above.
. Use *Configure log forwarding* and select the scope for log forwarding.
* label:AuraDB-Business-Critical[] A specific instance will have its logs forwarded.
* label:AuraDB-Virtual-Dedicated-Cloud[] All instances in the selected region will have their logs forwarded.
* label:AuraDS-Enterprise[] All instances in the selected region will have their logs forwarded.
. Select the type of logs to forward: *Security logs* or *Query logs*.
* For query logs, it is possible to apply certain filters to decrease the volume of forwarded data.
. Follow the instructions specific to your cloud provider.

[NOTE]
====
Only one log forwarding configuration of each type is permitted for each unique scope.
====

=== Query log filters

To apply filters to query logs, expand the Filter section in the log forwarding configuration wizard.

Neo4j queries produce two log entriesâ€”a start entry indicating that the query was started, and an end entry containing the result of the query execution.

The option *Remove start entries* allows you to only forward the end entries, which is sufficient for most analytical use cases and cuts the egress volume by almost half.

The *Include* dropdown selects whether to forward all queries, only successful queries, or only failed queries.

== Output destination

Log forwarding can forward logs to the log service of the same cloud provider as the monitored instance is located in.

Cross-region log forwarding is supported.

If your instance is in:

* *Google Cloud Platform* - Forward logs to Google Cloud Logging in your own GCP project.
* *Amazon Web Services* - Forward logs to CloudWatch in your own AWS account.
* *Azure* - Forward logs to a Log Analytics workspace in your own Azure subscription.

Logs can be further forwarded into third party systems using the log routing capabilities provided by your cloud provider.
